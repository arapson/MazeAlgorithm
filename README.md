# MazeAlgorithm

Video Link: https://youtu.be/NLLG8ylsfr4

 Objective of Program:
 
 + Design and implement a GUI based C++ application to randomly construct an n X n maze 
   with a path from a start cell to an end cell.
 + Implementation of  an adjacency list, "equivalence classes", the "union-find" algorithm, 
   depth-first search of an undirected graph, and some understanding of the GUI programming.
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Requirements:
 
 + Decide on a data structure that will hold the Maze ADT.
 + Remove walls from the maze.
 + Decide on a data structure for a bidirectional undirected Graph ADT (used adjacency list).
   Construct the graph using the information stored in your Maze ADT
 + Write a Stack based depth-first search algorithm that traverses the Graph 
   ADT finding a path from the start to end cell. Store your path in the Stack.
 
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Controls:
 
 + right click to open an options menu.
 + Reset - Resets the Maze to an plain grid.
 + Create Maze - Deletes walls and creates the maze foundation.
 + Draw Path - draws a plath within the created maze from the start to the finish.
 + Quit - Quits the program.
